## Members

- `changelog.en.md`: English build-time milestone snapshot synchronized from public Bottega docs.
- `changelog.zh-CN.md`: Simplified Chinese snapshot synchronized from public Bottega docs.
- `changelog.ja.md`: Japanese snapshot maintained by the website repository.
- `changelog.fr.md`: French snapshot maintained by the website repository.
- `changelog.es.md`: Spanish snapshot maintained by the website repository.

All snapshots preserve the English entry dates, order, and item counts. The i18n content test enforces this contract.

`sync:changelog` refreshes only the two synchronized snapshots. When it brings in a new entry, the three
maintained translations must gain the same entry in the same change — otherwise `pnpm check` fails on
the next run, which is exactly how the `v0.1.0` entry was found missing from all three.

Entries use `**bold**` and `` `code` `` only. A markdown link survives as its label and loses its
address (see `lib/changelog.ts`): the upstream links point into the docs repository, and those paths
do not exist on this site.

[PROTOCOL]: Update this file when members or responsibilities change, then verify the project README.md.
