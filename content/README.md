## Members

- `changelog.en.md`: English build-time milestone snapshot synchronized from public Bottega docs.
- `changelog.zh-CN.md`: Simplified Chinese snapshot synchronized from public Bottega docs.
- `changelog.ja.md`: Japanese snapshot maintained by the website repository.
- `changelog.fr.md`: French snapshot maintained by the website repository.
- `changelog.es.md`: Spanish snapshot maintained by the website repository.

All snapshots preserve the English entry dates, order, and item counts. The i18n content test enforces this contract.
All five snapshots include v0.1.1, v0.1.2, and v0.1.3. Builds read committed content without synchronizing it; new upstream releases enter through the explicit synchronization and translation workflow below.

`sync:changelog` refreshes only the two synchronized snapshots. When it brings in a new entry, the three
maintained translations must gain the same entry in the same change — otherwise `pnpm check` fails on
the next run, which is exactly how the `v0.1.0` entry was found missing from all three.

Entries use `**bold**` and `` `code` `` only. A markdown link survives as its label and loses its
address (see `lib/changelog.ts`): the upstream links point into the docs repository, and those paths
do not exist on this site.

[PROTOCOL]: Update this header when making changes, then check README.md.
